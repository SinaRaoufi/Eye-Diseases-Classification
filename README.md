Eye Diseases Classification with LSTM using pytorch


## Dataset:
The dataset consists of Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, and Glaucoma retinal images, where each class has approximately 1000 images. These images are collected from various sources like IDRiD, Oculur recognition, HRF, etc.

The dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification

## Model:
I use Convolutional neural network (CNN) for this classification.
